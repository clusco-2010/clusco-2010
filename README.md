### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**clusco-2010/clusco-2010** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project takes a list of items sold during a day at a grocery store and gives the user the option to see all items sold with quantities, a particular item that was sold
  and it's quantity, or print the items sold with a histogram representing the quantity (Appless *****). It combined python and C++ which added additional challenges. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I did well with solving the last two choices of the menu.  It was easier for me to print out the items to a file and change the quantity to a symbol or print out one item. 
  The first part which of course helped with the other two menu items really  caused me a lot of issues.  I kept hitting road blocks and could not ge the code to work.  I later found 
  a simple issue that was holding it back.  Passing values from C++ to Python was also something I did well. I understood the transaction and that helped me a lot.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There were a couple of things I could have enhanced. 1) for menu option 2 I should have listed the items alphabetically and 2) should have made sure to capitalize the users input
  as all items started with a capital.  I also could have made it more enhanced if I asked the user for the filename instead of hard coding the file name we were given. To make it more secure, I should have made some items private within functions instead of public. Overall it was efficient, but I did end up repeating 
  some code, which is usually not a good coding. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging piece was solving the first part of the menu display all items and their total quantites sold.I solved this by finding a simple mistake in adding to the total
  of each item. I was incrementing the wrong variable.  I overcame this using my past sessions and chapters as well as some internet help on loops.  Some resources that are helpful 
  are my peers, the internet search is a big help when trying to find examples and tutorials (youtube, google search, etc.)
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   Working with multiple languages, for loops, overwriting variables in functions are some transferable skills that can help on other projects.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I added a lot of comments as to what i was trying to accomplish, since we were given some starter code, I removed any that was not necessary for the program I built.  I think 
   that is adaptable becasue it can take in any number of items and produce the results.
